## ⚡ Performance Notes

- **Lightweight**: No external images required (SVG cricket ball)
- **Smooth**: 60 FPS animations using Framer Motion
- **Fast**: Loader completes in 5.5 seconds total
- **Efficient**: Uses CSS transforms for optimal performance

## 🎭 Taglines Rotation

The loader cycles through these phrases:
1. "Warming up the pitch..."
2. "Setting the field..."
3. "Getting ready to bowl..."
4. "Match starting soon!"

Each tagline shows for 1.5 seconds with smooth fade transitions.

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Change Loader Duration
In `src/App.tsx`, modify the timeout:
```tsx
const timer = setTimeout(() => setLoading(false), 5500) // Change 5500 to your preferred duration
```

In `src/components/CricketLoader.tsx`, adjust progress speed:
```tsx
return prev + 1; // Change interval or increment for different speed
}, 45); // Change 45ms to adjust speed (lower = faster)
```

### Modify Taglines
In `CricketLoader.tsx`, edit the `taglines` array:
```tsx
const taglines = [
  "Your custom message 1...",
  "Your custom message 2...",
  "Your custom message 3...",
];
```

### Adjust Colors
All colors use Tailwind classes. Replace color values in the component:
- `bg-[#002B5C]` → Main backgrounds
- `text-[#FFCC29]` → Gold text
- `from-[#FFD65C]` → Gradients

### Change Ball Speed
Modify the spring physics:
```tsx
transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 90, damping: 12 }}
// Increase stiffness for faster movement
// Decrease damping for more bounce
```
