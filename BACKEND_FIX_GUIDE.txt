BACKEND PLAYER FILE URL STORAGE FIX
====================================

PROBLEM:
Frontend sends player files correctly, but backend doesn't save Cloudinary URLs to database.

ROOT CAUSE:
Backend uploads files to Cloudinary but never appends the returned URLs to the database INSERT statement.

SOLUTION:
In your backend registration endpoint, after uploading files to Cloudinary, add the URLs to the player record.

Code example:
    aadhar_url = cloudinary.uploader.upload(aadhar_file)['secure_url']
    subscription_url = cloudinary.uploader.upload(subscription_file)['secure_url']

Then include in INSERT:
    INSERT INTO players (player_id, name, aadhar_file, subscription_file)
    VALUES (player_id, name, aadhar_url, subscription_url)

VERIFICATION:
Check database with: SELECT aadhar_file, subscription_file FROM players LIMIT 1
Should return full Cloudinary URLs, not NULL
Admin dashboard will then display all files correctly
