# Jersey Number State Management - Verification Complete ✅

## Bottom Line

**Your Concern:** Ensure onChange/state updates keep jerseyNumber

**Our Finding:** ✅ **VERIFIED - NO ISSUES - ALREADY SAFE**

---

## The Code That Keeps It Safe

```typescript
// Registration.tsx, lines 183-187
const updatePlayer = (index: number, data: Partial<PlayerData>) => {
  const players = [...formData.players]
  players[index] = { ...players[index], ...data }  // ← SAFE ✅
  setFormData({ ...formData, players })
}
```

This pattern:
1. Spreads ALL existing player fields first
2. Then overwrites ONLY the fields being changed
3. Result: jerseyNumber stays unless explicitly changed

## What We Verified

### The 7 onChange Handlers

1. Name input: `{ name }` → jerseyNumber preserved ✅
2. Age input: `{ age }` → jerseyNumber preserved ✅
3. Phone input: `{ phone }` → jerseyNumber preserved ✅
4. Role input: `{ role }` → jerseyNumber preserved ✅
5. Jersey input: `{ jerseyNumber }` → updated + others preserved ✅
6. Aadhar upload: `{ aadharFileBase64, aadharFile }` → jerseyNumber preserved ✅
7. Subscription upload: `{ subscriptionFileBase64, subscriptionFile }` → jerseyNumber preserved ✅

### The State Flow

```
PlayerFormCard onChange
    ↓
updatePlayer(index, { changedField: newValue })
    ↓
players[index] = { ...players[index], ...{ changedField: newValue } }
    ↓
Result: { ...all existing fields..., changedField: newValue }
    ↓
jerseyNumber PRESERVED (unless it was the changedField) ✅
```
